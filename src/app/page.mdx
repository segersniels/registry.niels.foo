# Introduction

Welcome to my opinionated collection of shadcn/ui inspired components
and hooks. This collection is designed to streamline your development
process and maintain consistency across your projects.

## What is shadcn/ui?

shadcn/ui is a collection of re-usable components built using Radix
UI and Tailwind CSS. It's not a component library, but rather a
set of beautifully designed and accessible components that you can
copy and paste into your apps.
